    <h1>A Weekend With SJ</h1>

<article class="saturday">
    <h2>What I did on Saturday</h2>
    <p>
        Left very early in the morning and went to the shopping place named la roca village.
        After this we went to Girona and watched them have a
        <a href="https://www.marca.com/futbol/laliga-ea-sports/girona-mallorca/2023/09/23/01_0101_20230923_2893_181-directo.html">great game</a>.
        Their performance lately has actually allowed them to casually walk into second place in the league
        after jornada 7. The only reason they do not hold the place of first is because of one
        goal against, leaving first place to FCB. With this exciting news we followed by a nice walk through the city
        of Girona and dinner at a nice resturant.

        <h2>What I did on Sunday</h2>
        <p>
            Left not so early in the morning to go to an amazing walk through
            a small pueblo named Breda for breakfast. Followed by an awesome tour of an old
            <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwju36T49cWBAxV2VqQEHbmTCbAQFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.montsoriu.cat%2Fhome%2F&usg=AOvVaw0PeR18Ups8nQE6l0rbm75d&opi=89978449">castle</a>
            . This tour was done in catalan so I even got a chance to practice my foreign language more.
            After seeing many cool features and hearing many stories (that I need much
            clarification for) we ran down the hill to get to the car to make it to the
            restaurant in time for our reservation. After an extremely tasty lunch
            we drove back to Barcelona just in time to siesta and wake up to watch
            athletico madrid kick real madrids ass in el derbi.
